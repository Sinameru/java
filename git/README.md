# Git & GitHub Basics

---

## What is Git?

* Git is a **free and open-source distributed version control system**.
* It allows developers to **track changes, collaborate, and roll back code** to previous versions.

## What is GitHub?

* GitHub is an **online platform to host Git repositories**.
* It provides features for **collaboration**, such as pull requests, issues, and project management.

## What is Version Control?

* Version control is the **management of changes to files and code over time**.
* It allows you to:

    * **Track history** of modifications.
    * **Collaborate safely** with teammates.
    * **Experiment** using branches without affecting the main code.

## Key Concepts

### Repository (Repo)

* A repository is a **project folder tracked by Git** containing code, history, and configuration.

### Commit

* A commit is a **snapshot of changes** in the repository.
* Each commit has a **unique ID** and a descriptive message.

### Branch

* A branch is a **parallel timeline** for development, allowing you to work on features without affecting the main code.

### Remote Repository

* A remote repository is a **Git repository hosted online**, like on GitHub, that others can access.

### Staging Area

* The staging area is a **place where changes are prepared** before committing.

## Summary

Git and GitHub together help developers **track code, collaborate efficiently, and maintain a clear history** of their projects.
